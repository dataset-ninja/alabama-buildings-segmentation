**Alabama Buildings Segmentation** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the geospatial domain and environmental industry. 

The dataset consists of 10200 images with 657483 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*building*).

Images in the Alabama Buildings Segmentation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022.
